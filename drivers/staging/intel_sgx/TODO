=============

* Improve Documents/x86/intel-sgx.txt based on the feedback and
  questions that pop up.

Internals
=========

* Move structures needed by the allocator to arch/x86/include/asm/sgx.h
* Move EPC page allocation and eviction code to arch/x86/mm as they
  will shared with virtualization code.
* Move enclave management functions to arch/x86/mm as they will be
  shared with virtualization code.
* Use reserve_memtype() in order to add EPC to the PAT memtype list
  with WB caching.
* Implement proper recovery code for the pager for cases when
  ETRACK/EBLOCK/EWB fails instead of BUG_ON(). Probably the sanest
  way to recover is to clear TCS PTEs, kick threads out of enclave
  and remove EPC pages.
* Implement ACPI hot-lug for SGX.

* Move isgx_user.h to arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/sgx.h
